Github proposed I make this readme file to introduce myself.

- 👋 Hi, I’m @LukaVercauteren
- 👀 I’m interested in computers
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Lua
- 💞️ I don't currently have anything to collaborate on, but feel free to contact me if you want to work together with me.
- 📫 You can reach me on Discord, feel free to DM me at any time
-   I use Github mainly for school projects.
-   I am currently using Ubuntu, with GNU Emacs, and I use the standard Lua compiler, which is available on the Lua website. I'm still testing Emacs for programming, and I might switch to an IDE if it doesn't work out.
