Github proposed I make this repo and readme file to introduce myself.

- 👋 Hi, I’m @LukaVercauteren
- 👀 I’m interested in computers
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Lua
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on school projects, mainly. I'm not even sure if I'm allowed to collaborate with anyone outside my class.
- 📫 You can reach me on Discord, feel free to DM me at any time

LukaVercauteren/LukaVercauteren is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
